## Day 1: March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a calculator app.

**Feeling**: ⁉️ Confused

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the logic on how this calculator should function. I gave it my best. I was able to change the display and save the input to a variable though!

## Day 2: March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a calculator app again, [codewars.com](http://codewars.com) and [freecodecamp.com](http://www.freecodecamp.com) problems.

**Feeling**: ⁉️ Confused AGAIN

**Thoughts:** I still wasn't able to get it, but I did go ahead and skim through an article and I would like to attempt it again tomorrow. Aside from working on the calculator, I did some work on codewars. I'm suprised at how little I know! I definitely struggled. The two problem sets I couldn't get were: [Regex validate PIN code](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55f8a9c06c018a0d6e000132) and [Your order, please](https://www.codewars.com/kata/your-order-please). I bookmarked them so I can come back to them. I also worked on some freecodecamp courses too. 

**Things I've learned/need to research**: 

> 1. Calculators are Hard!
> 2. I keep using regEx for everything(should read more on it)
> 3. I need to learn more about Arrays and their methods
> 4. I am tired of sorting arrays
> 5. I am not stupid, just need to learn more.                                     
> 6. I NEED GLASSES THAT DONT MAKE MY EYES HURT

## Day 3: March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Rock Paper Scissors Game (Console), [theOdinProject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav)

**Feeling**: 🤔😓 Confused, and a bit frustrated 

**Thoughts:** I was not expecting this game to take a while. I think I may be rusty on the Javascript that I've learned 2 years ago and should probably do a bit of refreshing. I pride myself on how quickly I learn, but this is somehow hurting my ego lol. THIS WAS A SIMPLE GAME?!?! WHY YOU DO THIS JAYE? Anywho, this took longer than an hour lol. I still have other projects I want to do today, but this library internet is slow! 

**Things I've learned/need to research**: 

> 1. I tried using 'let' to declare a variable in the playRound function, but I realized that since 'let' had block scope I think it never got 'rewritten' when I redeclared it in the while loop, hence I was stuck in an infinite loop. That's my best guess, but I must look into that.
> 2. LIBRARY WI-FI SUCKS

## Day 4: March 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: FreeCode Camp Exercises & JS30 Drum Kit

**Feeling**: 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬

**Thoughts**: I spent most of the day trying to figure out what I should be learning/coding and not actually doing anything. I ended with a plan to work on freecodecamp until I can't, then do a project (hopefully) tied to what I learned (or just do a JS30 project for now). I hope this plan works🙃. I also think I overwrote my calculator project from yesterday, I did my best to restore it... not that there was much to restore 😂. I was super happy I had my JS30 Drum Kit functional before going 100% into the tutorial. I AM PROUD! 😢 <~~ Happy tear. I wonder why 'happy tear' isn't an emoji yet...

**Worked On**:

* Calculator (this is going to be the death of me)
* FreeCodeCamp Basic Javascript Problems
* Javascript 30 JS Drum Kit
* Started to watched video about CSS-grids!

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. If you want your border-radius to apply to all nested elements, make sure you have "overflow: hidden;" in the parent element... DUH! (regarding calculator)
> 2. I learned of the "Data-key" attribute
> 3. I definitely think too much.

**Next Steps**:

* Even though I got the Drum Kit to work, I need to actually follow the tutorial to get it running smoothly. I want to also add css animations that are equivalent to the name of the sound! Also, I need to finish this calculator!!!!
* Start a DailyUI project
* Do a CSS project

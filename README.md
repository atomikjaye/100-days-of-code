## Day 1: March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a calculator app.

**Feeling**: ⁉️ Confused

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the logic on how this calculator should function. I gave it my best. I was able to change the display and save the input to a variable though!

## Day 2: March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a calculator app again, [codewars.com](http://codewars.com) and [freecodecamp.com](http://www.freecodecamp.com) problems.

**Feeling**: ⁉️ Confused AGAIN

**Thoughts:** I still wasn't able to get it, but I did go ahead and skim through an article and I would like to attempt it again tomorrow. Aside from working on the calculator, I did some work on codewars. I'm suprised at how little I know! I definitely struggled. The two problem sets I couldn't get were: [Regex validate PIN code](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55f8a9c06c018a0d6e000132) and [Your order, please](https://www.codewars.com/kata/your-order-please). I bookmarked them so I can come back to them. I also worked on some freecodecamp courses too.

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. Calculators are Hard!
> 2. I keep using regEx for everything(should read more on it)
> 3. I need to learn more about Arrays and their methods
> 4. I am tired of sorting arrays
> 5. I am not stupid, just need to learn more.
> 6. I NEED GLASSES THAT DONT MAKE MY EYES HURT

## Day 3: March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Rock Paper Scissors Game (Console), [theOdinProject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav)

**Feeling**: 🤔😓 Confused, and a bit frustrated

**Thoughts:** I was not expecting this game to take a while. I think I may be rusty on the Javascript that I've learned 2 years ago and should probably do a bit of refreshing. I pride myself on how quickly I learn, but this is somehow hurting my ego lol. THIS WAS A SIMPLE GAME?!?! WHY YOU DO THIS JAYE? Anywho, this took longer than an hour lol. I still have other projects I want to do today, but this library internet is slow!

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. I tried using 'let' to declare a variable in the playRound function, but I realized that since 'let' had block scope I think it never got 'rewritten' when I redeclared it in the while loop, hence I was stuck in an infinite loop. That's my best guess, but I must look into that.
> 2. LIBRARY WI-FI SUCKS

## Day 4: March 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: FreeCode Camp Exercises & JS30 Drum Kit

**Feeling**: 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬

**Thoughts**: I spent most of the day trying to figure out what I should be learning/coding and not actually doing anything. I ended with a plan to work on freecodecamp until I can't, then do a project (hopefully) tied to what I learned (or just do a JS30 project for now). I hope this plan works🙃. I also think I overwrote my calculator project from yesterday, I did my best to restore it... not that there was much to restore 😂. I was super happy I had my JS30 Drum Kit functional before going 100% into the tutorial. I AM PROUD! 😢 <~~ Happy tear. I wonder why 'happy tear' isn't an emoji yet...

**Worked On**:

-   Calculator (this is going to be the death of me)
-   FreeCodeCamp Basic Javascript Problems
-   Javascript 30 JS Drum Kit
-   Started to watched video about CSS-grids!

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. If you want your border-radius to apply to all nested elements, make sure you have "overflow: hidden;" in the parent element... DUH! (regarding calculator)
> 2. I learned of the "Data-key" attribute
> 3. I definitely think too much.

**Next Steps**:

-   Even though I got the Drum Kit to work, I need to actually follow the tutorial to get it running smoothly. I want to also add css animations that are equivalent to the name of the sound! Also, I need to finish this calculator!!!!
-   Start a DailyUI project
-   Do a CSS project

## Day 5: March 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp (Basic Javascript)

**Feeling**: 💪🏾💪🏾😅😢✨

**Thoughts**: I DID THE THING! I finished the Basic Javascript course... well sorta, I skipped over parts I knew. I felt the need to review Basic Javascript because I felt some problems on codewars.com really stumped me. So I assumed it was because of my rusty Javascript skills, and by rusty I mean I totes forgot all I learned 2 years ago 😅.

--- a few hours later _spongebob narrarator voice_ ---

I spent all day learning and coding. Unfortunately I feel like I got NOWHERE today, as I thought I would finish the multiple projects I wrote down (like Daily UI, Javascript30 (second project) etc.).. but I didn't. I'm a bit bummed because I feel like this means I didn't progress. However, looking back at what I have done, I learned some new things... no matter how small... and that is still progress!

**Worked On**:

-   Finishing FreeCodeCamp [Basic Javascript]
-   Javascript 30 Drum Kit Again (adding [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) animations to the buttons)

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. Arrays are actually pretty awesome. Idk why I thought they were terrible.
> 2. I learned about .git/info/exclude.
> 3. Selectors will be the main cause of all my problems. Took me about 2 hrs figuring out which selector I needed. Thanks to a viewer a few streams ago, I was able to locate which ones I needed through Google Chrome's Dev Tools.
> 4. I can make my own "data-x" thingies and select those. That's what I am using for these animations!

**Next Steps**:

-   FINISH CALCULATOR
-   Start a DailyUI project
-   Do a CSS project

## Day 6: March 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30 Clock & Some reading

**Feeling**: 🙂

**Thoughts**: I went out today, it was a much needed break. I totally feel like I cheated and only did about 30-45ish mins out of the 60mins req. BUT I DID A THING OKAY! I followed along with the JS30 tutorial, but I paused in a few areas to make sure I was on the right track. I think I did okay. However, because I didn't know some functions existed like "getMinutes()" or "getHours()" I was going to do entirely too much math. In a way I felt better because I know it's not necessarily an "I suck at logic" thing, but a "I don't know what I don't know" thing. 🙌🏾 I am also reading an actual book 🎉🎉💃🏾💃🏾🎉🎉💃🏾💃🏾 . Judge me if you wish lol, but I don't read books much, I usually read news articles etc, but not books. It's always made me feel bad for some reason. BUT I AM READING OKAY GUYS! Maybe I will get better at english lol. The book I am reading is called [Confident Coding: Master the Fundamentals of Code and Supercharge Your Career By Rob Percival](https://amzn.to/2FeGM4b) \*affiliate link.

**Worked On**:

-   JS30 Clock
-   Reading stuffs

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. Transform-Origin: css property
> 2. TRANSITION-TIMING-FUNCTION CUBIC-BEZIER !!!! OMG !!!! 🧠💣
> 3. I need to brush up on some math skills

**Next Steps**:

-   Have nightmares about this unfinished JS Calculator.
-   I'll figure it out on monday.. on a brain break 😅

## Day 7: March 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30 CSS Variables & FCC ES6

**Feeling**: 😩😶🤷🏾‍

**Thoughts**: I was feeling off all day. Really didn't feel like doing much of anything

**Worked On**:

-   JS30 CSS Variables
-   FCC ES6 Lesson

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. :root; had it officially introduced to me in JS30 ^.^
> 2. Setting defaul variables by simply adding "||," LIKE DUH JAYE! That makes sense!! Why didn't you think of this?!
> 3. CSS VARIABLES ARE AMAZING!!!! **RESEARCH: Can you set a whole class as a variable? Like if I want something to have a border and box shadow, can I make that class a variable?**
> 4. I thought I knew what the spread and rest operators do, now I am not so sure. **RESEARCH**
> 5. Destructing an array: CooL!!

**Next Steps**:

-   Do something next time...

## Day 8: March 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS Calculator

**Feeling**: 💪🏾🎉✨🙂🤔

**Thoughts**: I didn't do anything for most of the day, but I GOT BASIC FUNCTIONALITY ON MY CALCULATOR!!!!! There are some kinks I need to fix, but it works... sorta!

**Worked On**:

-   JS Calculator

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. [.includes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes) is a thing
> 2. [How to build a JS Calculator...](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98) Helped me A LOT. I tried not to look at it too often.

**Next Steps**: (list of bugs)

-   Fix calculator decimal situation
-   When you click addition the second time, you want the current sum to be displayed regardless if the "equal" button was pressed.
-   After sum if added, if you click another number, it gets added to the display... should not happen.
-   Add Keyboard functionality

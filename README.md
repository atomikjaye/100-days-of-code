## Day 11: March 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30 Flex Panel Gallery & Ajax Type Ahead

**Feeling**: 😡😡😭😲✨🎉

**Thoughts**: I got the gallery working with my own code, but followed tutorial, which I admit was better. I then wanted to add a close toggle type of thing... AND I SUCCEEDED! WOOT!
I didn't have the same "I beat the tutorial" feeling with the Ajax Type Ahead one. I pretty much followed it to the "T". I realized Ajax isn't super complicated as I thought. I want to figure out a small project
where I can use this!

**Worked On**:

- JS30: Flex Panel Gallery
- JS30: Ajax Type Ahead

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. Ajax is pretty cool, it also stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML... which honestly got me all confused again. So I will include a definition that clarified what it was.
>     AJAX is abbreviated for Asynchronous  JavaScript And XML. AJAX is the idea that data can be loaded without refreshing the entire page. [Quora - William Green](https://qr.ae/TW85Rb)

**Next Steps**:
-

## Day 12: March 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30 Array Cardio 2

**Feeling**: 😑😑😐😓

**Thoughts**: I almost lost my streak of programming today. I honestly felt like doing ABSOLUTELY nothing. I read a few tutorials (sorta) and was going to learn React, but failed. I did manage to do a quick Wes Bos JS30 lesson.
I think the amount of time I spend day-to-day will make up for my lack today lol.

**Worked On**:

- JS30 Array Cardio 2

**Things I've learned/need to research**:

> 1. console.table() IS AN ACTUAL THING?!?!? WHAT????!!!! Where has this been in my short dev life?!
> 2. Learned about array.some() and array.every()! Pretty cool stuff.
> 3. Tried to make a markdown snippet, but realised it wasn't working.. Apparently you need to Ctrl + Space for it to show up... intertesting [issue #1617](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1617). I also used part of this tutorial [Make Snippets](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/write-less-code-by-creating-snippets-in-visual-studio-code)

**Next Steps**:
-  Spend more time tomorrow working on code.
- Learn React and convert subwall project.
- Spend more time building actuall small projects!

## Day 14 : March 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30 Canvas

**Feeling**: 😓☹😡☹😕😵✨😅😎

**Thoughts**: I really didn't feel like coding all yesterday and today tbh. I did manage to fit a JS30 tutorial in, but I know I could have worked harder. I WAS SUPER AMAZED at the canvas tutorial tough. It's magic! ✨ :O

**Worked On**: 
- JS30 Canvas!
- Dev breakfast (?? IDK what will come of this)

**Things I've learned/need to research**:
> 1. globalCompositeOperation [globalCompositeOperation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation)
 
**Next Steps**: 
- DO MORE WORK
